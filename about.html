<b>∞ about brigante pomodoro (<a href="index.html">back<a> | <a href="https://github.com/non/brigante">code</a>)</b>

brigante pomodoro is a todo system that combines a <i>pomodoro
technique</i> with a <i>stochastic scheduler</i> based
on <i>multi-armed bandits</i>.

on this site, you can input tasks any time you think of them. these
tasks can be very small or very large, it's up to you.

these tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, meaning if you
refresh the web page they will still be there. (this also means your
tasks will not follow you between different computers or web
browsers.)

---

<b>∞ how to use brigante pomodoro:</b>

when you are ready to start working on a task (e.g. start a 25-minute
pomodoro interval) you click <b>start random task</b>.

at the end of the pomodoro interval, you report back your results:

 * <b>done</b>: the task is complete (and should be removed)
 * <b>great</b>: the task went well (increasing its likelihood of being chosen again)
 * <b>ok</b>: the task went ok (no change in likelihood)
 * <b>not great</b>: the task went poorly (decreasing its likelihood of being chosen again)

the goal here is to help reduce <i>decision paralysis</i> for people
who have lots of ideas of things to do, and to keep them feeling
productive. for tasks that are urgent but difficult, this weighting
system is not likely to be optimal.

currently this site does not provide built-in timers or pomodoro
enforcement. you can also enable cheating, which allows you to choose
which tasks to start. one other use case for this is to mark tasks
completed which you already finished, or which you not longer want
listed.

finally, you can use <b>erase all tasks</b> to completely reset your
data, deleting all history, all previous tasks, etc.
